## Notes of Interest

### Historical Chinese-Spanish Lexicography — *Dictionario Hispanico Sinicum*

The world's oldest and largest Spanish-Chinese dictionary was discovered
at the University of Santo Tomas (UST) archives in Manila. The
*Dictionario Hispanico Sinicum* dates to the Spanish colonial era in
the Philippines and was written entirely by hand — an astonishing feat
of scholarship given its size and the complexity of cross-referencing
two completely unrelated writing systems without any of the tools we
take for granted today.

This project's eventual name, **Dictionarium Sinicum**, is a nod to
that manuscript tradition.
